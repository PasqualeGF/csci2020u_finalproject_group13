<br />INSTRUCTIONS: <br />
There are two parts to this project, the Agent and the Client. <br />
Both can be found in the chatservice folder within the src folder (csci2020u_finalproject_group13-master/src/main/java/chatservice). <br />
In order to run, please open the Gradle project in an IDE such as IntelliJ. <br />
If using IntelliJ, you can select build.GRADLE in the csci2020u_finalproject_group13-master folder and click Edit with IntelliJ. <br />
To run the files, select the Gradle menu on the right, then select "Tasks", then "other". <br />
Finally, click runAgent and once Agent is running, click runClient. <br />
The server connection should now be established, allowing communication between the two programs. <br />
In order to chat, you must first enter a name in the form at the top of the screen. <br />
Either party can send a message to the other by using the bottom messaging form and clicking the "Reply" button. <br >
Both parties can also save a text file copy of the chat using the "Save" button in the top right corner of the window. <br />
Finally, the Agent can load a product text file using the "Load Product" button to the left of the "Save" button. The product files can be found in the folder "products".
