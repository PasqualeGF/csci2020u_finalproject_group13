INSTRUCTIONS: <br />
There are two parts to this project, the Agent and the Client. <br />
Both can be found in the chatservice folder within the src folder (csci2020u_finalproject_group13-master/src/main/java/chatservice). <br />
In order to run, please open the Gradle project in an IDE such as IntelliJ. <br />
If using IntelliJ, you can select build.GRADLE in the csci2020u_finalproject_group13-master folder and click Edit with IntelliJ.
To run the files, select the Gradle menu on the right, then select "Tasks", then "other". <br />
Finally, click runAgent and once Agent is running, click runClient. <br />
The server connection should now be established, allowing communication between the two programs. <br />
