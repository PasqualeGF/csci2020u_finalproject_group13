There are two parts to this project, the Agent and the Client. <br />
Both can be found in the chatservice folder within the src folder (src/chatservice). <br />
First, run the Agent file to create server, then run the Client file. <br />
The server connection should now be established, allowing communication between the two programs. <br />
